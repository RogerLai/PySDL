PySDL
=====

Similar projects first:

* The equally named [PySDL on SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pysdl). Last update was from 2000. Implemented in C.
* [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/). Actively developed. Implemented in C. Is not a straight-forward 1:1 binding to SDL but has a different API.

How does this **PySDL** differ?

* Purely implemented in Python.
* Straight-forward 1:1 binding to SDL.
