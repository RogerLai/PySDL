PyCParser
=========
<https://github.com/albertz/PyCParser>

A **C** parser written in Python. Also includes an automatic ctypes interface generator.

It is a bit loosely on the C grammer, i.e. it should support a superset of the C language in general.

Some of the support may a bit incomplete or wrong at this point because I didn't really strictly followed the language specs but rather improved the parser by iteration on real-world source code.

Similar projects:

* [pyclibrary](https://launchpad.net/pyclibrary) ([Github fork](https://github.com/albertz/pyclibrary)). Is quite slow and didn't worked that well for me.

Why this project?

* Be more flexible. It is much easier now with a hand-written parser to do operations on certain levels of the parsing pipe.
* A challenge for myself. Just for fun. :)
