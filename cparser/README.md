PyCParser
=========

A **C** parser written in Python.

It is a bit loosely on the C grammer, i.e. it should support a superset of the C language in general.

Some of the support may a bit incomplete or wrong at this point because I didn't really strictly followed the language specs but rather improved the parser by iteration on real-world source code.
